I am a neuroscientist and 2023 [Schmidt Science Fellow](https://schmidtsciencefellows.org/fellow/sridevi-venkatesan/) at the Hospital for Sick Children and University of Toronto, Canada. I use experimental neurophysiology and computational biology techniques to understand and develop treatments for human neurodevelopmental disorders. I am interested in leveraging evolutionary insights to understand the origins of human brain disease. Checkout my [research interests.](/research/)
