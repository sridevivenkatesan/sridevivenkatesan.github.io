## Neurophysiology 
During my PhD at the University of Toronto, I worked with [Dr. Evelyn Lambe](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VsXQD8oAAAAJ&hl=en) studying the neurophysiology of several brain disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and genetic epilepsy using two-photon microscopy, electrophysiology, and optogenetics. I discovered fundamental mechanisms of acetylcholine signaling in the brain that modulate attention and developed targeted treatments to boost attention in Alzheimer's disease. Checkout my book chapter on the [role of acetylcholine in attention](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/7854_2020_138) and some key papers<sup> [1](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/40/38/7255.full.pdf), [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-023-01531-5).</sup>

## Functional genomics 
As a postdoctoral fellow, I work with [Dr. Jesse Gillis](https://thedonnellycentre.utoronto.ca/faculty/jesse-gillis) and [Dr. Yun Li](https://lab.research.sickkids.ca/li/) on the functional genomics of human neurodevelopment. I use single-cell genomics, machine learning, statistics, and meta-analytic approaches to compare developing brain cell types across species and model systems such as brain organoids. I am interested in leveraging evolutionary insights to understand the origins of human brain disease. Checkout my recent preprint on a method to predict developmental age in [brain organoids](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.24.639936v1). I collaborate with international colleagues through [BICAN](https://www.portal.brain-bican.org/) on generating a complete single-cell atlas of the developing human brain.
