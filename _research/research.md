## Neurophysiology and Functional Genomics 
During my PhD at the University of Toronto, I worked with [Dr. Evelyn Lambe](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VsXQD8oAAAAJ&hl=en) studying the neurophysiology of several brain disorders, including  Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and genetic epilepsy using <b>two-photon microscopy, electrophysiology, and optogenetics</b>. 

As a postdoctoral fellow, I work with [Dr. Jesse Gillis](https://thedonnellycentre.utoronto.ca/faculty/jesse-gillis) and [Dr. Yun Li](https://lab.research.sickkids.ca/li/) on the functional genomics of human neurodevelopment. I use <b>single-cell genomics, machine learning, statistics, and meta-analytic approaches</b> to compare developing brain cell types across species and model systems such as brain organoids. I am interested in leveraging evolutionary insights to understand the origins of human brain disease. 

## Key Research Outcomes
1. I discovered fundamental mechanisms of acetylcholine signaling in the brain that modulate attention and developed targeted treatments to boost attention in Alzheimer's disease. Checkout my book chapter on the [role of acetylcholine in attention](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/7854_2020_138) and some key papers<sup> [1](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/40/38/7255.full.pdf), [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-023-01531-5).</sup> 

2. I investigated rare neurodevelopmental disorders caused by disruption of the essential glutamatergic NMDA receptor. I identified that [lifelong deficits in NMDA receptors](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-023-01619-y) disrupt cortical signaling essential for cognition but this can be genetically rescued in adulthood. This lays the groundwork for future gene therapies targeting NMDA receptors. My work has led to the development of [precision anti-epileptic treatments for a human patient variant of the NMDA receptor](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.01.619946v2) based on deep mechanistic investigation.

3. Checkout my recent preprint on a method to predict [developmental progression in brain organoids](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.24.639936v1). I collaborate with international colleagues through BICAN on generating a complete [single-cell atlas of the developing human brain](https://www.portal.brain-bican.org/).
